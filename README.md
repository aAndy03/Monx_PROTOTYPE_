# Finance Timeline Web App

Built with v0.dev

It was an idea I had. You may find it strange. But I like to experiment with how data can be visually shown. 
The dashborad design it's kind of boring, although some designers do a great job.

Unfinished project. [PROTOTYPE]
DO NOT USE IT TO TRACK YOUR REAL TRANSACTIONS.

Works: 
1. auth
2. project timeline creation manager
3. timeline redners based on start and end dates
4. all shortcuts 
5. inline transaction modal
6. inline transaction indicators and their status indicators (1x - 3x)
7. edge limit breaker when on layers (hour through month)

Obvious bugs:
1. Transaction cards (4x - 5x)
2. Others you will SURELY find with basic usage.

Not yet implemented:
1. Multiple accounts/wallets
2. Multi currency and exhange rate
3. Background inline interactive charts (day to year)
4. Inline summarizer (upward relative to timeline)

Enviroment:
Building outside v0 env. can introduce some errors. 

Free use with credit if using this code. The ideea is free. :))
